# medicaldatabase
Database for medical research group to store and take an overview of data.

The database stores the measurements of study subjects. At least following characterizations will be stored:
* Clinical parameters
* Genetic risk alleles
* Liver histology
* Sleep questionnaire

In total, approximately 50-70 variables will be stored. Not all the measurements are made from all the subjects. 

**Main function of the database** is to present an visualized overview of data for group professionel, e.g.:
* What is the proportion of women?
* What is the distribution of genetic risk alleles? For how many subjects we have made the characterization?
* How many subjects have NAFLD?

Only the research professionel will be allowed to enter the database.

The database will be a prototype, and measurements from approximately 10-20 imaginary subjects will be stored.
