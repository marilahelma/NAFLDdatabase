Database for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) medical research group to manage and take an overview of patient data.

The database stores the measurements of study subjects. At least following measurements will be stored:
* Clinical parameters
* Genetic characterization
* Liver histology
* Sleep questionnaire

In total, approximately 50-70 variables will be stored. Not all the measurements are made from all the subjects. 

**Main function** of the database is to present visualized overview of data for the group professionel, e.g.:
* What is the proportion of women?
* What is the distribution of genetic risk alleles? For how many subjects we have made the characterization?
* How many subjects have NAFLD?

Only the research professionel will be allowed to enter the database.

The database will be a prototype, and measurements from approximately 10-20 imaginary subjects will be stored.
